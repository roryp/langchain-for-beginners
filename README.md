## 🦜🔗 Welcome

Welcome to **LangChain for Beginners**! This course has 7 lessons covering the fundamentals of building with LangChain and Python. Each [lesson](#️-lessons) covers its own topic so start wherever you like! You should always start on the `README.md` page of a lesson. To **get started** right away you can open [course-setup](/00-course-setup/), though you're encouraged to read the overview below first.

### What You'll Learn and Build

This course takes you from zero to building robust AI applications:

- **Conversational AI** - Build context-aware chatbots with streaming responses and customizable behavior
- **Semantic Search** - Create search systems that understand meaning, not just keywords
- **Function Calling & Tools** - Give AI the ability to use tools and extract structured data
- **Autonomous Agents** - Build agents that reason, make decisions, and choose tools autonomously
- **MCP Integration** - Connect AI to external services using the Model Context Protocol standard
- **Agentic RAG** - Build intelligent Q&A systems where agents decide when to search your knowledge base

**By the end**, you'll have a solid understanding of LangChain and understand how to build real AI applications you can deploy!

> **Teaching Approach:** This course uses an agent-first progression. You'll learn about tools, then agents, then combine them with document retrieval to build agentic RAG systems. This mirrors how modern production AI systems are built.

Don't forget to [star (🌟) this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/langchain-for-beginners/stargazers) and [fork this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/langchain-for-beginners/fork) to run the code.
