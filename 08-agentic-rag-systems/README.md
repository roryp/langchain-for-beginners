# Building Agentic RAG Systems

In this chapter, you'll learn how to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems where agents intelligently decide when to search documents and how to answer questions.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Documents, Embeddings & Semantic Search](../07-documents-embeddings-semantic-search/README.md)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Understanding of embeddings and vector search

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Understand what RAG is and when to use it
- ✅ Build basic RAG systems
- ✅ Create agentic RAG with decision-making
- ✅ Implement retrieval tools for agents
- ✅ Handle multi-document Q&A
- ✅ Build conversational RAG systems
- ✅ Optimize retrieval strategies

## 📚 Code Examples

Check the `code/` directory for Python examples demonstrating:

1. **Basic RAG** - Simple question-answering over documents
2. **Agentic RAG** - Agents that decide when to search
3. **Multi-Document RAG** - RAG across multiple sources
4. **Conversational RAG** - RAG with conversation history
5. **Advanced Retrieval** - Hybrid search and re-ranking
