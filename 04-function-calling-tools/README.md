# Function Calling & Tools

In this chapter, you'll learn how to extend AI capabilities by giving models access to tools and functions. You'll understand how to define tools, bind them to models, and handle structured outputs.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Prompts, Messages, and Structured Outputs](../03-prompts-messages-outputs/README.md)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Understanding of Pydantic models

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Define custom tools with Pydantic schemas
- ✅ Bind tools to language models
- ✅ Handle tool calls and responses
- ✅ Create type-safe function interfaces
- ✅ Build multi-tool applications
- ✅ Extract structured data with function calling
