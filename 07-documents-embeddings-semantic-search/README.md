# Documents, Embeddings & Semantic Search

In this chapter, you'll learn how to load documents, create embeddings, and build semantic search systems that understand meaning, not just keywords.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](../06-mcp/README.md)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Understanding of vector concepts (basic)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Load and process documents from various sources
- ✅ Create vector embeddings from text
- ✅ Understand document chunking strategies
- ✅ Build vector stores for semantic search
- ✅ Perform similarity searches
- ✅ Choose the right embedding model
- ✅ Implement efficient document retrieval
