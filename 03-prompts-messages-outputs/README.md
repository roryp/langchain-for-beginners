# Prompts, Messages, and Structured Outputs

In this chapter, you'll learn the three essential techniques for working with LLMs in LangChain: **messages**, **prompt templates**, and **structured outputs**. Understanding these techniques is key, because modern LangChain applications choose different approaches depending on the use case.

## Prerequisites

- Completed [Chat Models & Basic Interactions](../02-chat-models/README.md)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Basic understanding of chat models

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Understand when to use messages vs templates
- ✅ Construct message arrays for agent workflows
- ✅ Create reusable prompt templates for RAG systems
- ✅ Use variables and dynamic content in prompts
- ✅ Implement few-shot prompting (teaching by example)
- ✅ Combine multiple prompts together
- ✅ Generate structured outputs with Pydantic
- ✅ Choose the right approach for your use case
